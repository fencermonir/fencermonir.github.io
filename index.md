The Foundation exists to promote philanthropy and create a stronger community in the Telluride region (San Miguel, Ouray and western Montrose Counties)

* I have made the theme from scratch
* Use WPBackery page builder for page content
* They have Grant Award Database of 20 years and they want to show there donation database to the user. I have made a custom functionality which can search & filter these data in three different ways.

**Project description:**

The Foundation exists to promote philanthropy and create a stronger community in the Telluride region (San Miguel, Ouray and western Montrose Counties)

* I have made the theme from scratch
* Use WPBackery page builder for page content
* This client needs to sell his modules on how to publishing book. I made custom functionality using <strong>WordPress CPT and Shortcode</strong> to show clients video content on How to publishing book. To watch these modules you have to be a valid user too. For now, I can only show the module page preview.
