<img src="images/TellurideFoundation.jpg?raw=true"/>

**Project description:**

The Foundation exists to promote philanthropy and create a stronger community in the Telluride region (San Miguel, Ouray and western Montrose Counties)

* I have made the theme from scratch
* Use WPBackery page builder for page content
* They have Grant Award Database of 20 years and they want to show there donation database to the user. I have made a custom functionality which can search & filter these data in three different ways.
